You're my person, and I can't do this without you. I've missed you so much, every day without you feels like a piece of me is missing. don't want to let go of what we had.

I know your afraid of going through that pain again.

I know it's hard, but we've been through so much together. I can't bear the thought of losing you completely. We've come so far and fought so hard for what we had. I believe that if we're honest with each other, and learn from our mistakes, we can find a way to make this work. We owe it to each other to try, to be open and vulnerable, and to build something real and lasting. I can't do this without you. Please, don't give up on us.
