There are days when everything feels off-balance and nothing seems to go right. Today was one of those days. I woke up late, rushed through my morning routine, and still missed the bus. By the time I arrived at work, I was already exhausted and the day had barely begun.

My frustration continued to build as the hours passed. Small annoyances became magnified - the coffee machine broke down, my computer crashed twice, and I couldn't find the files I needed for an important meeting. I found myself getting irritated at everyone and everything around me.
