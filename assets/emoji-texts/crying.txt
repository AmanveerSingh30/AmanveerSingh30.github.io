Sometimes tears come unexpectedly, catching me off guard. I might be watching a movie, listening to a song, or simply sitting quietly when suddenly I feel the warmth of tears on my cheeks. It's as if my heart is speaking a language that words cannot express.

I used to think crying was a sign of weakness, something to be hidden away. I would apologize for my tears, trying to stop them before anyone could notice. But I've come to understand that tears are a form of release, a way for the body to express emotions too complex for words alone.

There's a certain cleansing that comes with crying. After the tears subside, I often feel lighter, as if I've released a burden I didn't know I was carrying. It's like the sky after rain - clearer, fresher, with the promise of something new on the horizon.

I'm learning to honor my tears rather than hide them. They're not a sign of weakness but of being fully human, of having the courage to feel deeply and authentically. And in a world that often encourages us to mask our emotions, there's a quiet strength in allowing ourselves to cry when we need to.
