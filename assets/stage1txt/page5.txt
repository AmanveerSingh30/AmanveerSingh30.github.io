The initial gaslighting felt familiar.  A problem arises when there is some miscommunication or misperception( understood the meaning of something in different ways)  between each other. I say one thing, you hear another, and suddenly we’re speaking different languages in the same room. You share that something hurt you. I explain, That’s not what I meant—that wasn’t my intention.

But now, you have your guards up, The past lingers like a shadow, whispering that this might be another trick, another slight, another denial of your reality. I get it. When someone has gaslit you before, your inner alarms start ringing even at the faintest scent of dismissal. Your mind and heart rush to protect you and as they should. But I'm not trying to fight your version of events. I'm here to understadn where our events touch and where they missed and to bridge that gap with care, not confusion.

But the only real way I can show you that I’m being genuine… is by talking it through with you, openly, fully and for you to truly hear me. When you leave, hang up, or walk away, it cuts off that chance and sends things down a spiral.

I get it though. From your perspective, it makes sense. You might be thinking, What if I let him speak, and he’s actually gaslighting me? What if I fall for it again? That fear is valid. After what you’ve been through, it’s only natural to protect your heart.

But you were the one who once said If we’re going to fix this, we’ll have to go through the pain again and again. We’ll cry, we’ll struggle, and we’ll try again and again and its going to be hard.

So I’m here now, asking you to take just one small step toward that promise. Trust me, just enough to talk. To sit in the fire with me, just for a moment. Let’s fight this problem together, not each other.

At the end of the day, what truly matters is stepping back and letting go of short-term anger so we can see the full picture. We both need patience, and we both deserve to be spoken to with softness and care.

We have to let go of those quick negative reactions, the moments when we ignore each other, push each other away, or make decisions driven by frustration. Instead, we have to do something incredibly difficult but deeply important: pause, breathe, and choose connection over conflict.

Our emotions can be powerful, overwhelming even. I know it’s not always possible for both of us to stay calm in the heat of the moment. But that’s why we need each other. When one of us starts to drift off course, it’s the other’s responsibility to stay grounded, and bring the other back and for the other to truly listen and accept that help.

I know we can be strong. I believe in us.
