I remember the day we first met, the rain was pouring down and you offered to share your umbrella. In that moment, I felt something I had never felt before - a connection, immediate and powerful. The way you smiled at me, I knew this was the beginning of something special.

Time flew by when we were together. We talked for hours about our dreams, our fears, and our hopes for the future. You showed me parts of the city I had never seen before, and I showed you how to see the beauty in the simplest things. We were perfect together, or so I thought.

Then one day, without warning, everything changed. Your messages became shorter, our calls less frequent. I could feel you slipping away but couldn't understand why. When you finally told me you needed space, I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces. The pain was unlike anything I had experienced before.

I've been trying to piece myself back together ever since. Some days are better than others. I still catch myself looking at old photos, remembering the good times, wondering what went wrong. But I'm learning that heartbreak, while painful, is also a teacher. It's teaching me about resilience, about self-love, and about the courage to hope again.
