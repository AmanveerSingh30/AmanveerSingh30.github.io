Your sentence = I'll remind you to put in Vaseline
My sentence = I’ll remind you to do jumping jacks

On Monday night…
------------------
On Monday night, we had a conversation where u told me that I don’t push you to go to the gym. Couple minutes later I was showing you the burns on my ass and you said your sentence. And then after that, I said my sentence. When I said that, I don’t remember if you cut the call. But you got angry like u felt some type of way. And you said that I’m trying to call you fat. I tried to explain my side. But it was clear you were having none of it.
And before I continue, I want to write it out for context.

- I was just showing you my bare ass five seconds before, it’s not like we were fighting or arguing  hence
- My sentence did not come from hatred or frustration
- You said I’ll remind you, and because we just had the conversation, it was on my mind, so I said I’ll remind you…
- And when I said it, I even remember I hesitated and then finished with jumping jacks
- I understand how that comes off, and if we never had the conversation before about pushing you to go to the gym, then ofc I too know it’s fully wrong
- What if I said, “I’ll remind you to go to the gym,” would u still have the same reaction? Because at its base, both sentences are about the same thing, but like I said, I hesitated and finished with jumping jacks because I added some banter into it
- That’s all it was, I was joking, it was banter, but u thought I was calling you fat.
- But if I were then I would just accept it and say sorry, I’m past that point of dragging that, if that was my motive to hurt u, then I would say yes, I was intentionally calling you fat and say sorry.
- But I wasn't, that was not my intention, and when I try to explain my intention, you think I’m gaslighting you. (I will come back to this later)







On Tuesday…
-------------
On Tuesday, things flipped completely from what I imagined them to be. I knew I had upset you on Monday and had to meet you in person and apologize, and communicate. So then what went wrong? I was taken aback seeing you fully closed off, I thought you were closed off to the point you don’t even want to hear me out. I think something that bothered me is that it’s clear you came because you wanted to resolve this, but by fully closing urself off, you're just making things difficult. And that bothered me.  Hence, when I was saying “why did you come here then, “ what I wanted to get out of that was that it was something like you came here to resolve this matter, but the way you're acting is not helping, and nothing is getting anywhere like this.

I got so caught up in trying for you to talk to me that I made the biggest mistake. I didn’t start the conversation myself.
You say how can I even expect that you would listen to me, or that I deserve you to show that you are listening to me. But I don’t think I’m wrong to ask for even 10 percent of participation when I’m trying to speak my heart and let myself be vulnerable.
But where I did make a mistake is that getting caught up in that, I forgot what I’ve learned about you, and how hard you are on the outside and want me to start, you know, speaking my mind first. This is something we have already been through, and you're right, I messed up there. No matter what I think about expecting and not expecting, we already know what needs to happen, and I should've remembered and done that from the beginning, like I have before.

Now the final part is that. I think I was so distraught by your leaving. Like that action for me was like you're walking away from me, from us. And yes ik I hurt u. I shouldn’t have held you like that. I’m sorry about that, for sure, that was my fault. But you were already trying to leave before that. Something that confuses me is when we talked in the car at the end, after the gym, you said Why are you acting crazy, You communicated things. I don’t understand why that couldn’t be done before.

In the gym, I was put back with how ok u were to walk away from things rather than solving them on the spot. Seeing that you would rather walk away than communicate and explain what you're feeling. That part got to me, and then I turned off my location, too, not wanting you to know I was in the gym. When u called and texted me, I didn’t reply right away, telling u where the car is and where I am, instead, I let things drag as I finished and came out. Trying to show I didn’t care, trying to stress you out.

Unacceptable. A reason for leaving me.

But there’s much to think about here. I know I am not that person. I know I am not that person who wants to inflict pain. I know I’m not that person who wants to fight. I know I am not that person who wants to lose themselves in rage.

But lately. I’ve been more mad and angrier, and frustrated. That’s not me. UK, that’s not me. Something that’s stuck in my head is when my mom called, and I smacked the steering wheel of the car when we were close to the French school beside McDonald’s. And that scared you. That day has been stuck in my head. Because I feel guilty. I know that’s not me and that’s not who I want to be.

That Tuesday. I had two options when I entered the gym. I saw u running and I could’ve gone and stood in front of you. Or I could stand behind you and then ignore you. And I chose the latter. But tell me I’m wrong, the man you know would’ve come and stood in front of the treadmill where you were running first.

All I know is that I messed up letting my frustrations determine my actions. But, one thing I know is that it is not who I was, that is not who I want to be. And that is not what I will be when I grow up. So when u said things like. Is this the husband you’re going to be? I say no. I have never hurt u like that before. I have never pulled off a stunt like that before, and I will never again. I say no, the husband I’m going to be won’t let his frustration get the better of me. I say no, the husband I want to be will communicate through the toughest times. I say no, the husband I want to be will follow your scent when you run away from me.

Disclaimer, I’m not saying bad about you or turning this on you. But once in a while you used to hit me when ur mad. Once upon a time, your eyes would be filled with rage, and you would smack me in the middle of my chest. But today, you're someone who places their hand on my heart even when I did something you didn’t like.

So I promise you, the next time, I will open the door for you and walk with you and run with you. And then come back and fill the emptiness in your heart with love.
