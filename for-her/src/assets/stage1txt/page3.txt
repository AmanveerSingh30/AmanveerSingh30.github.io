I was asked to figure out my emotions figure out my perspective of things. But what I said scared me. I said, I don’t know , I can’t figure myself out without her . I felt so hopeless, I felt like I needed you, the one person that can read me like a book and help me figure out my emotions. In that moment how scary this is. since  the age of 14 I’ve been growing up beside you.. seeing the world from mine but your eyes too. And there’s no doubt you ahve always been the the mature one, the more well spoken one and hence the more dominant one when it comes to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong. Most of the times when our views conflict we arrive at the conclusion that what you’re saying is correct and I put my opinions aside.

You say that you don't want to date a baby and I'm not saying that I'm a baby, but I have been with you and you have been guiding me under your protection since I was 14

I've been seeing the world from your eyes. I've been seeing myself from your eyes for so long. I've lost a sense of what's right and what's wrong I've lost a sense to decide for myself and make up for myself to stand my own ground because I just fear that if you think that what I think is not acceptable what if you think what I think is not right

And to tell you the scariest part, I don’t even know if all of this I’m saying is true or if I’m lying to myself to believe something that’s not. It’s like I need your validation for something definitive for me.
