The littlest mistakes are important to you and the biggest mistakes are forgivable for me.
When you surprise me things food baskets it’s your way of love or saying sorry even if I say not to do it. In time of fights you close down and I need willingness.your well spoken about ur words and feelings and I’m not.

We need to understand our difference not as flaws or failures, but as the threads that weave the unique fabric of us. If we’re going to do this we can’t treat our differences as mistakes or problems.  These are things that makes us us. These aren’t things we need to change, maybe, over time, some will soften, shift, or grow. But right now, they are not obstacles they are invitations. Invitations to adapt, to learn each other’s rhythms, to meet in the beautiful space between who you are and who I am.

It’s easy to walk awa to turn your back, eyes fixed away, and never look behind. It’s easy to sit in silence, pretending the world outside the window is more enjoyable. To count passing cars and strangers like they matter more than the person sitting beside you. It’s easy to shift the weight of pain onto someone else’s shoulders and question them when they cannot handle it..

But sometimes, the smallest spark, a single look, a quiet word, a hand reaching out can light up what feels lost. That tiny moment of effort can be the thread that stitches two hearts back together. And in that choice lies the difference between a love that fades… and one that finds a way to grow.
