I’ll never walk away. Even when it’s hard to love you, even when your words are cold, even when you’re silent, even if you gave me a reason to give up.

In this world of temporary people and conditional love, we’ve found something real, and I can’t loose that.

I want to live life with you, I want to experience life with you. Which means the highest of the peaks and the lowest points in life I want to do it all.

I love you, and when you love somebody, you work it out, you don’t just throw it away.
