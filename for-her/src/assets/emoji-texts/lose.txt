I just want us to be mature, talk things out, focus on our goals, worry about our future, be all about each other and our successes, grow up together, love each other right, heal our inner child together, do the little cute things together, enjoy the little moments, have long deep conversations with each other, love each other unconditionally and never fall out again,
because I really don't want to

lose you..
